# Fractals

This example show how a fragment shader can be used to visualize fractal sets, which make some beautiful and infinitely zoomable pictures! It also shows how to use the mouse and keyboard within a JOGL application. Please read accompanying README file.

# CircleInClass

This is the starter code for the example in class to draw a circle.

# CircleSolution

This program shows how to draw a bouncing circle. It is the final product of the example in class.

# ObjViewer 

This example shows how to draw 3D models in OpenGL. It also shows how to import 3D models in the OBJ file format to our programs.

# Fans

This example shows how to set up transformations hierarchically for an object using stacks of matrices. This allows us to specify complex transformations in terms of simpler ones.

This example is the result of a class activity (possibly generating a different animation but the same concept)

# CameraViews

This example shows how lookAt works. This example will be extended in class to support first-person shooter (FPS) cameras.

# Scenegraphs

This is the basic example for rendering scene graphs. A scene graph is input as an XML file. Several XML examples are included.

# LightsAndTextures

This example shows how to add lights and textures to a simple scene and draw it using OpenGL.

# LightsTexturesInClass

We will start from this example in class to study lighting and texture  mapping.

# SceneCapture

This example and accompanying description shows how to augment your program to capture and export screens into image files. They can be stitched into a video showcasing your program (look at the description to see how to do this).
