/**
 * This interface captures all the operations that a scene graph should offer.
 * It is designed to be a generic scene graph that is independent of the actual rendering library
 * It achieves this by working with an {@link sgraph.IScenegraphRenderer} interface
 *
 * The scene graph provides functions to store actual geometry (object instances) within itself
 * so that they can be shared within many leaves. Each node of the scene graph keeps a reference
 * to it, enabling any node of the scene graph to directly call its functions.
 *
 * Conversely the scene graph also stores references to all the nodes keyed by their name. This
 * way the scene graph can directly refer to any of its nodes by name instead of traversing
 * the tree every time to find it. This is useful when nodes must be identified and animated
 * in specific ways.
