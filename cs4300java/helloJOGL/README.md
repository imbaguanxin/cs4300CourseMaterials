# HelloJOGL0

This example how to draw using OpenGL directly (without any scaffolding code). It shows how to draw using glDrawArrays and glDrawElements.

# HelloJOGL

This basic program shows how to draw 2 triangles that share vertices on screen using JOGL using one color.

# HelloJOGL2

This program extends HelloJOGL, by drawing the same two triangles but specifying one color per vertex. This also introduces the modelview matrix to transform the object in simple ways.

# HelloJOGL3

This program extends HelloJOGL2 by showing:

1. How to draw the same object multiple times.

2. How to display text

3. How to set the window to continuously redraw itself (animation loop) and how to measure
frame rate.
