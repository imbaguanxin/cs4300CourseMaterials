# HelloQt0

This example how to draw using OpenGL directly (without any scaffolding code). It shows how to draw using glDrawArrays and glDrawElements.

# HelloQt

This basic program shows how to draw a triangle on screen using Qt and OpenGL using one color.

# HelloQt2

This program extends HelloQt, by drawing the same triangle but specifying one color per vertex. This also introduces the modelview matrix to transform the object in simple ways.

# HelloQt3

This program extends HelloQt2 by showing:

1. How to draw the same object multiple times.

2. How to display text

3. How to set the window to continuously redraw itself (animation loop) and how to measure frame rate.
